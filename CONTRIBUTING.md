# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Inertia.js! Your contributions help make this project better for everyone.

Inertia.js is maintained as a monorepo using [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces). Below you'll find an overview of the repository and how to get your development environment running.

> **Note:** You'll need **pnpm version 10 or higher**. If you're unsure which version you have, run `pnpm -v`.

### Key Components

* **Core Library:** The framework-agnostic engine powering all adapters (`packages/core`).
* **Adapters:** Framework-specific integrations for React, Svelte, and Vue.
* **Test Applications:** Minimal frontend apps used for automated testing (`packages/*/test-app/`).
* **Playwright Tests:** Framework-agnostic end-to-end tests that verify behavior across adapters (`tests/*.spec.ts`).
* **Playgrounds:** Full Laravel applications for manual testing (`playgrounds/`). These are optional and may eventually be removed.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia.git inertia
cd inertia
pnpm install
```

Then, start the development environment:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This builds the core library and all adapters, and starts a file watcher that will automatically rebuild each package when changes are made.

If you prefer, you can also start individual watchers from each package directory. For example:

```sh
cd packages/core && pnpm dev
cd packages/react && pnpm dev
```

> **Note:** The core package (`packages/core`) must always be running, as all adapters depend on it.

## Running Tests

Inertia.js uses Playwright to run a shared end-to-end test suite against each adapter. This is how we verify that Inertia behaves the same across React, Svelte, and Vue.

Run the test suite for a specific adapter:

```sh
pnpm test:react
pnpm test:svelte
pnpm test:vue
```

These commands automatically set a `PACKAGE` environment variable that tells the Node.js test server which adapter to serve. For example, when running `pnpm test:react`, the test server loads the React test application.

If you want to run Playwright directly, you can pass the environment variable yourself:

```sh
PACKAGE=react playwright test
```

You may filter tests by name:

```sh
pnpm test:react -g "partial reload"
```

Run tests in headed mode (to see the browser):

```sh
pnpm test:vue --headed
```

Or in debug mode:

```sh
pnpm test:vue --debug
```

### How the Test Setup Works

All adapters use the same Node.js backend and Playwright test suite. The only difference is which adapter's test app is served.

```
tests/app/server.js         Shared Node.js backend
├── serves: react test app  (when PACKAGE=react)
├── serves: svelte test app (when PACKAGE=svelte)
└── serves: vue test app    (when PACKAGE=vue3)

tests/*.spec.ts             Shared Playwright test suite
```

When running a test command, the correct adapter is selected automatically:

| Adapter | `PACKAGE` value | Test server port | App URL                                            |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| React   | `react`         | 13716            | [http://localhost:13716/](http://localhost:13716/) |
| Svelte  | `svelte`        | 13717            | [http://localhost:13717/](http://localhost:13717/) |
| Vue 3   | `vue3`          | 13715            | [http://localhost:13715/](http://localhost:13715/) |

### Automatic Test Server Boot

You do not need to start the test server manually. When you run a test, Playwright automatically builds the frontend for the selected adapter and boots the Node.js test server before running the tests. This is configured in the Playwright config (`playwright.config.ts`) using the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#webserver) option. If a server is already running (for example, during local development), Playwright will reuse it.

## Running Test Applications

The test applications are the primary development environments for Inertia.js. These minimal apps cover all supported features and are used for both manual development and automated end-to-end testing.

Run all test apps at once:

```sh
pnpm dev:test-app
```

Or start an individual one:

```sh
pnpm dev:test-app:react
pnpm dev:test-app:svelte
pnpm dev:test-app:vue
```

Each test app runs two servers:

* A Node.js backend that automatically restarts when changed
* A Vite development server for the frontend

If you are developing a new feature or fixing a bug, you can use these test apps to develop and test your changes.

## Adding Tests

If you are fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving existing functionality, please verify that your changes work across all adapters, not just one.

### 1. Add Frontend Pages

Create the same frontend page in each test application:

```
packages/react/test-app/Pages/YourFeature.jsx
packages/svelte/test-app/Pages/YourFeature.svelte
packages/vue3/test-app/Pages/YourFeature.vue
```

Each page should provide the same behavior and functionality.

### 2. Add Backend Routes (If Needed)

If your change requires a backend route, add it to the shared Node.js test server:

```javascript
// tests/app/server.js
app.get('/your-feature', (req, res) =>
  inertia.render(req, res, {
    component: 'YourFeature',
    props: { foo: 'bar' },
  }),
)
```

### 3. Write a Playwright Test

Add a new Playwright test to verify your change. Playwright allows us to test features across all adapters without duplicating test logic.

```typescript
// tests/your-feature.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('your feature works', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/your-feature')
    // Your assertions here
})
```

### 4. Run the Tests in All Adapters

Be sure to run your test for each adapter:

```sh
pnpm test:react -g "your feature"
pnpm test:svelte -g "your feature"
pnpm test:vue -g "your feature"
```

Your work is not considered complete until it works consistently across all frameworks.

## Using the Playgrounds (Optional)

The repository also includes several full Laravel applications that integrate Inertia.js. These are optional and mostly useful for manually exploring how Inertia works inside a real Laravel app.

The playgrounds are provided as-is and are not part of the automated test setup. They may be removed in the future.

### Getting Started

If setting up a playground for the first time:

```sh
cd playgrounds/react
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Then start the playground:

```sh
pnpm dev:playground:react
```

Visit the application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Each playground has its own pnpm script:

```sh
pnpm dev:playground:react
pnpm dev:playground:svelte4
pnpm dev:playground:svelte5
pnpm dev:playground:vue
```

## Publishing (Maintainers Only)

When preparing a release:

1. Bump the versions in each `package.json` file.

2. Run `pnpm install` to update the lockfile.

3. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of changes.

4. Publish the packages:

   ```sh
   pnpm publish -r
   ```

   For beta releases, add the `--tag=beta` flag:

   ```sh
   pnpm publish -r --tag=beta
   ```

5. Tag a new release on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/releases).
